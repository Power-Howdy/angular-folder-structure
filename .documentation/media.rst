Media Directory
===============

`~/media <../media>`_

The ``media`` directory is used to store supporting files for the application.  Things like requiremenets docs, text outlines, etc.  This is the junk drawer for the project.  

``media`` can be used for compiling bootstrap.  Extract the bootstrap project into media then modify the ``scss/_variables.scss`` then compile.  Link the dist boostrap.min.css into your assets directory and you've got a custom bootstrap.
