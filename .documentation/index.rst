Angular Folder Structure
========================

This project is an example of directory structure in an Angular application but it is also a working application.

Here we cover the parts of the application directory structure and the function of each:

* `core <core.rst>`_
* `data <data.rst>`_
* `layout <layout.rst>`_
* `module <module.rst>`_
* `shared <shared.rst>`_
    
Be sure to check our `additional resources <additional-resources.rst>`_ for further reading on how to 
improve access to and readability of your modules.
