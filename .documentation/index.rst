Angular Folder Structure
========================

This project is an example of directory structure in an Angular application but it is also a working application.

Here we cover the parts of the application directory structure and the function of each:

* `~/media <media.rst>`_
* `~/src/theme <theme.rst>`_
* `~/src/app/core <core.rst>`_
* `~/src/app/data <data.rst>`_
* `~/src/app/layout <layout.rst>`_
* `~/src/app/module <module.rst>`_
* `~/src/app/shared <shared.rst>`_
    
Be sure to check our `additional resources <additional-resources.rst>`_ for further reading on how to 
improve access to and readability of your modules.
