Highly Scalable Angular Folder Structure
========================================

The project is inspired by the article on Medium called [How to define a highly scalable folder structure for your Angular project](https://itnext.io/choosing-a-highly-scalable-folder-structure-in-angular-d987de65ec7) by Mathis Garberg. The project is based on best practices from the community, other github Angular projects and developer experience from production Angular projects.
