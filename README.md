Highly Scalable Angular Folder Structure
========================================

The project is inspired by the article on ITNEXT called
"[How to define a highly scalable folder structure for your Angular project](https://itnext.io/choosing-a-highly-scalable-folder-structure-in-angular-d987de65ec7)"
by Mathis Garberg. Based on best practices from the community, other github
Angular projects, developer experience from production Angular projects, and
contributors to this reposiory, this project goal is to *create a skeleton
structure which is flexible for projects big or small*.
